# sudoko_solver_by_gams_optimization
In this exersize, I solved sudoko puzzel using mathematical models with gams. 

This is not the best way to sudoko the puzzel. But its a great template for using gams API in python.

I had written this code for one of my projects in combinational optimization course presented by Dr. Hooshmand On December 10, 2021 in Amirkabir University of technology.
